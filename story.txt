[setting-location+ time] Zion's thingie
on the sun, in the immense city of Mad gas car, there lived 6 characters.  Bob, Anette, Yellow bellied sun sucker, Hoochy koochy, Harold mcdarreld, Brown Eyes.  They had a problem, but that is not for me to tell you. So, I will tell you a bit about this place, which is very interesting if you like folding laundry, but anyhow, I would like to tell you that this is not a very interesting part of the story to tell you about Vanishing scratch but anyhow........................................................
You probaly know all about Mad gas car, I am guessing. But I will describe it for you. Mad gas car is very cold, freezing tempatures go all the way to 66 degrees below zero. Nice tempatures, huh? Also, has a population of 33 creatures, there might  be mre though, so never mind. Just so you know, Mad gas car is also known as The great Blown-apart, but any how, Mad gas car, of course, is famous for it's walking and talking  hamburgers, which are edible. (they always wear sunglasses when you first get them from the burger restraunt but set them in the fridge for a few days and they loose their cool and wear beanies.)  Mad gas car, as you probaly have heard, is on the sun. The sun is home to creatures,(like in our story) and is very hot. The sun is striped, with curlicues, as well to add interest, as you probaly also know, green and blue.. more like teal, though. Also,  as you also know,  the sun has very scorching tempatures, so you could fry a superduperawesomelycrazy shishkabob in a millenia if you put it on the sun. Next to the sun, there is  it's sister planet, supercalifragiispialidociouseventhoughthesoundofitissomethingquiteatrocious, which also enjoys nice frying tempatures. On this planet, the cackling barbeque has just been invented(it actually cackles when the talking burgers are ready) and the sprinting computer, as well.(it did present some problems because when you turn on the computer runs away and they are not fun to catch, mind you. there was a lot of complaints about this subject) (especially in a certain computer class where all the computers ran away) Well, enough about sprinting computers. The sister planet, probaly will not be in the story, though. Our story takes place in the future as you probaly also know, and many things have been invented. The airplane skis which will zoom over jumps at 1,000,000 mph, and have brakes as well. (they also cost $1,00,334,555,337,100,338,999,000. 33 so you might want to save up just a bit before buying them) And, the talking burgers, as well, as I already mentioned. The Vanishing Scratch tools, if you want to get rid of Scratch forever! very effective and has 12 golden stars!!! Brown Eyes prefers it to the Gitscratch method. But.. any how.Also, the read itself book too. Now, to the story.....s
