 In this dence forest, the Seven-Sun-'Splores Club (or the Three S's Club), including Bob, Annette,  YBSS (Yellow-bellied-sun-sucker), Huchie-Cuchie, Harold McDarrel, Harry McLarry,  and Brown Eyes, wondered further into the poring rain.
	"Bob, are we almost there?" Harry asked
	"Almost where?" Bob answered.
	"Then are we alomst somewhare?" Harold asked.
	"Guys, how many times have you asked that?" Annette rolled her eyes.
	"This time I agree with Harold." Bob sighed. "Unfortunately, Harold, I dont know."
	"B.E., are you okay?" Annette asked Brown Eyes.
	"Ya, just worn out, we have been walking for days and have gotten nowhere!" the brown panther gasped.
	"YBSS, YBSS, YBSS, YB---" 
	"What are you doing, YBSS?" Huchie-Cuchie asked.
	"Look I think we are--"
Before Bob finished his sentence, a familiar, yet not friendly face appeared before him.
	"GUYS, RUN!" Bob yelled. But before anyone could get away, a large bamboo cage fell over them.
	"Ha, you think we cant escape this?" YBSS scoffed.  Suddenly lasers surrounded it, then a medal box over that, then a electric 70 foot tall gate surrounded that. Everyone gave YBSS a dirty look.
A loud voice came out of speakeres above them
	"You have three days to give me the Heart of the Sun! MWAHAHAHAHA!"
