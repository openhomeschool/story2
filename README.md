# The "story2" project
## openhome.school Computer Class

This project asks students to contribute blindly to a collaborative story.
Each student writes a part of the story, commits, and pushes; the story is then git-merged together.
After the merge, each student will update his/her part of the story, to help it integrate with the
rest of the story now discovered.

## Details

As usual, get ("git") the repository itself via:

```sh
cd ohs
git clone https://github.com/openhomeschool/story2.git
cd story1
```

Open story.txt to see the "parts" of the story -- you'll be assigned a part.

When you're ready to commit your part to github:

```sh
git commit -a -m"progress on my part"
git push
```

At this point, you'll be asked for a username and password.  You'll be given this credential
information in class.
